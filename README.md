# Calculator
Simple Windows calculator based on the iPhone calculator.

As an effort to grow and maintain my C# coding skills I've begun creating projects and hosting them on github.  This is one of those projects.

A simple calculator uing  Windows forms & .Net to create a calulator that is based on the builtin calculator on the iPhone sans the scientific mode (for now).

TODO:
 
	Deal with results that return scientific notation.  They get a little chunky right now.
  
	Implement a scientific mode that uses advanced mathematical functions, memory storage, exponents, parentheses, etc...
